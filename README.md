## Mapping Chinese Studies Curriculum
### What are the Most Assigned Texts in the Field?

This is an archive for all notebook files created for the Mapping Chinese Studies Project.

How is Chinese Studies taught in the United States? What are the most assigned texts in the field? And how do different disciplines interact with one another? You can explore these questions through an interactive dashboard. Each bubble represents an assigned text. Its size represents the popularity, and its color indicates the disciplinary affiliation. As you observe these clusters, you may also discover how this field has been evolving in the past few decades. I used Google Books API to retrieve the title's descriptions and applied text clustering methods (TFIDF, PCA, ...) to generate an interactive scatterplot. All syllabus data is sourced from the OpenSyllabus Project and cleaned by Junting Huang.
